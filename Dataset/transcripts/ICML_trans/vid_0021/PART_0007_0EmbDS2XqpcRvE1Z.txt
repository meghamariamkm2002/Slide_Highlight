In the state-only or LFO setting, we compare against Apollo, once again using only a single extra trajectory, and importantly, CFO uses identical hyperparameters as the pre-rate setting.
The figure shows two versions of CFO compared with Apollo, one estimating the next state distribution issue while the other limiting itself to the single state distribution.
Both incarnations of CFO distinctly outperform the LFO-tailored Apollo on every imitation learning metric.
