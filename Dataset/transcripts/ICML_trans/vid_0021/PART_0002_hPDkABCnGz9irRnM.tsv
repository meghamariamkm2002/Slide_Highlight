1170	8297	So onto our approach, our divergence of choice is the reverse KL whose minimization may be viewed as an RL problem with rewards being the log distribution ratios.
8778	14063	Thus, given any estimate of the ratio, any RL algorithm can be used for solving the IL objective.
14443	18467	So a naive approach would be to train two density estimators, say flows independently.
18988	23031	Practically, this means alternating between learning them and using their log ratio as your reward.
23692	24672	This fails when tried.
24813	26013	We'll see this again in the ablation.
26373	32036	And the failure can be further understood through what we term the BC graphs corresponding to an estimator for the log distribution ratio.
32696	40680	The full description is in the paper, but intuitively, a lack of an upward trend implies failure in RL, which is precisely what occurs in the figure for the independent flows.
41160	43081	This connection is also formalized in the paper.
43681	45902	What we have here is a problem of out-of-distribution data.
45982	48483	The flow's values are meaningless when evaluated on each other's data.
48844	50184	We need to tie them together somehow.
50564	51725	They must be coupled.
