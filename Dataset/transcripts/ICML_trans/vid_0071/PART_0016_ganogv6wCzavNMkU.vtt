00:00.009 --> 00:06.752
However, even if there exists meaningful patterns in the training data, the DNM may still not learn these concepts.

00:07.592 --> 00:12.554
A typical example is when the task can be conducted with some shortcut solutions.

00:13.635 --> 00:20.118
In this case, the DNM probably converges to the shortcut solution, without encoding complex concepts.
