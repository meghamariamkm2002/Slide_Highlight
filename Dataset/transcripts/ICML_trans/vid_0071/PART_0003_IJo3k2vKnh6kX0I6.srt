Based on cooperative game theory, we have a mathematical tool to formalize this idea.

00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:10,172
So let me first introduce some preliminaries of this framework.

00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:16,393
First of all, the DNN encodes interactions between different input variables for inference.

00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:27,955
For example, in the sentence, he is a green hand, a DNN may memorize the interaction between words in green and hand that pushes the DNN's inference towards the meaning of a begin
