Based on cooperative game theory, we have a mathematical tool to formalize this idea.

00:06.731 --> 00:10.172
So let me first introduce some preliminaries of this framework.

00:11.072 --> 00:16.393
First of all, the DNN encodes interactions between different input variables for inference.

00:17.173 --> 00:27.955
For example, in the sentence, he is a green hand, a DNN may memorize the interaction between words in green and hand that pushes the DNN's inference towards the meaning of a begin
