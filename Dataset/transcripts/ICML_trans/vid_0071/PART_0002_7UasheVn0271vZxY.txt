Before diving into the main topic, let us understand concepts from the perspective of a DNN.
Briefly speaking, each concept is activated when all pixels or words composing this concept exist.
For example, when we feed a basket image or a basket sentence to the DNN, no concept will be activated.
However, when less portion of the input sample is masked, as shown in these two examples, more concepts will emerge.
