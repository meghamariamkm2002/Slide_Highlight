Based on cooperative game theory, we have a mathematical tool to formalize this idea.
So let me first introduce some preliminaries of this framework.
First of all, the DNN encodes interactions between different input variables for inference.
For example, in the sentence, he is a green hand, a DNN may memorize the interaction between words in green and hand that pushes the DNN's inference towards the meaning of a begin
