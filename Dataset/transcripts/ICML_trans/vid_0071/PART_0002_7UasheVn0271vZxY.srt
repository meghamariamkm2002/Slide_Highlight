Before diving into the main topic, let us understand concepts from the perspective of a DNN.

2
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:14,650
Briefly speaking, each concept is activated when all pixels or words composing this concept exist.

00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:22,615
For example, when we feed a basket image or a basket sentence to the DNN, no concept will be activated.

4
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:31,837
However, when less portion of the input sample is masked, as shown in these two examples, more concepts will emerge.
