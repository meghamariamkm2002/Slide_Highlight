Our work is motivated by accumulative point-in-the-ring attack, which utilizes the sequential order property of real-time data streaming for sneaky point-in-the-ring generation.

00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,855
We raised the following question.

00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:25,938
Can we also explore the information of modal dynamics to gain some useful clues to identify the imperceptible accumulative point-in-the-ring attacks?
