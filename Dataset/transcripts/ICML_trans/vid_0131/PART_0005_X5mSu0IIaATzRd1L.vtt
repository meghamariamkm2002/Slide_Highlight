00:01.923 --> 00:11.629
And we also propose the discrepancy of weird sample correction based on the memorization discrepancy to defend against the accumulative poisoning attacks.

00:13.070 --> 00:24.438
Different from the AT variant of gradient clipping, which is indispensable to handle the poisoning sample or cleaning samples,

00:25.373 --> 00:35.598
our discrepancy over a sample correction can selectively correct some potential point in the examples and achieve the better performance.
