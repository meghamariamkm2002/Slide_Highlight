And we also propose the discrepancy of weird sample correction based on the memorization discrepancy to defend against the accumulative poisoning attacks.
Different from the AT variant of gradient clipping, which is indispensable to handle the poisoning sample or cleaning samples,
our discrepancy over a sample correction can selectively correct some potential point in the examples and achieve the better performance.
