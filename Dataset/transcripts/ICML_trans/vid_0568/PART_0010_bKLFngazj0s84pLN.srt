state in the cycle.

00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,992
The figure shows how the state of the system is influenced by the instantaneous minima of the energy surface.

3
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:13,514
The black line VD is slow changing and modulates the minima near the memory states depicted by colored circles.

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:20,977
VF which are green crosses always follow the instantaneous minima red circle which in turn is modulated by VD.

5
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:35,243
The resulting system is a two scale time scale dynamical system where in short time scale the system behaves as a static associative memory model attracting to its fixed point while in longer time scales the attractor states can change over time.
