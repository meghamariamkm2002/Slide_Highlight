1370	6053	The general sequential episodic memory model or G's and D's deals with these two limitations.
6533	11597	We derive G's M by introducing asymmetric synapses with signal propagation delays in the GAMM.
12257	19002	The asymmetric synapses result in the temporal behavior of the model and the delay stabilizes individual memories over time.
