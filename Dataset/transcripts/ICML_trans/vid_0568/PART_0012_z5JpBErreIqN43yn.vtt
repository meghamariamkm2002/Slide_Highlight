improvements in capacity observed in singleton memory models, dense GSM improves the capacity of existing sequence models.

00:07.170 --> 00:13.232
It can be seen that current memory models fall in the low end of the capacity spectrum suggested by the dense GSM.

00:13.932 --> 00:18.273
Models that have dense capacity can be found in degree 15 end of the spectrum.

00:18.893 --> 00:24.194
In summary, we introduced a new theoretical paradigm of adiabatic energy for the design of temporal memory models.

00:24.733 --> 00:30.055
This unified the static and dynamic properties of memory under a single theoretical paradigm of energy.

00:30.515 --> 00:35.997
We hope that future works can utilize the theory to improve existing memory models.

00:36.477 --> 00:43.100
Further, dense GSM may be directly used in applications requiring low overhead, high capacity sequence memory storage.
