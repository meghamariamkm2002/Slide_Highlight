29	9676	And in GSM, the state of the system converges to the nearest attractor, while that change in state results in the creation of a new attractor state where the system subsequently transitions.
10716	17521	The energy surface of GSM have two parameters, the state of the system VF and the delay signal VED governing its minima.
18221	27388	The figure shows the minima of this system changes over time as VD changes when a cyclical sequence of memories, memory 4 to 5, 6, 7 and then back to 4.
29938	37975	Since VD is delayed VF, the cyclical sequence that is stored results in a system that is never in equilibrium, always transitioning to the next
