9	749	state in the cycle.
2110	6992	The figure shows how the state of the system is influenced by the instantaneous minima of the energy surface.
7472	13514	The black line VD is slow changing and modulates the minima near the memory states depicted by colored circles.
14094	20977	VF which are green crosses always follow the instantaneous minima red circle which in turn is modulated by VD.
21886	35243	The resulting system is a two scale time scale dynamical system where in short time scale the system behaves as a static associative memory model attracting to its fixed point while in longer time scales the attractor states can change over time.
