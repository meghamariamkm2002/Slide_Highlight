First, I will describe the general associative memory model which we extend in our work.

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:11,372
Until recently, energy models were constrained to retrieve single memories from a set of stored memories.

00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:18,294
These models have a general architecture called the GAMM, composed of two layers of neurons with symmetric interactions.

00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:23,876
The symmetry leads to a dissipative dynamical system that converges to a single state under mild conditions.
