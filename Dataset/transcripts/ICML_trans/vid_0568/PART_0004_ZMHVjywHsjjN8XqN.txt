The general sequential episodic memory model or G's and D's deals with these two limitations.
We derive G's M by introducing asymmetric synapses with signal propagation delays in the GAMM.
The asymmetric synapses result in the temporal behavior of the model and the delay stabilizes individual memories over time.
