00:01.370 --> 00:06.053
The general sequential episodic memory model or G's and D's deals with these two limitations.

00:06.533 --> 00:11.597
We derive G's M by introducing asymmetric synapses with signal propagation delays in the GAMM.

00:12.257 --> 00:19.002
The asymmetric synapses result in the temporal behavior of the model and the delay stabilizes individual memories over time.
