improvements in capacity observed in singleton memory models, dense GSM improves the capacity of existing sequence models.
It can be seen that current memory models fall in the low end of the capacity spectrum suggested by the dense GSM.
Models that have dense capacity can be found in degree 15 end of the spectrum.
In summary, we introduced a new theoretical paradigm of adiabatic energy for the design of temporal memory models.
This unified the static and dynamic properties of memory under a single theoretical paradigm of energy.
We hope that future works can utilize the theory to improve existing memory models.
Further, dense GSM may be directly used in applications requiring low overhead, high capacity sequence memory storage.
