First, I will describe the general associative memory model which we extend in our work.
Until recently, energy models were constrained to retrieve single memories from a set of stored memories.
These models have a general architecture called the GAMM, composed of two layers of neurons with symmetric interactions.
The symmetry leads to a dissipative dynamical system that converges to a single state under mild conditions.
