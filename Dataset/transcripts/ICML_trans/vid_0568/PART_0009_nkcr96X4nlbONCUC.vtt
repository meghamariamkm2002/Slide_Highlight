00:00.029 --> 00:09.676
And in GSM, the state of the system converges to the nearest attractor, while that change in state results in the creation of a new attractor state where the system subsequently transitions.

00:10.716 --> 00:17.521
The energy surface of GSM have two parameters, the state of the system VF and the delay signal VED governing its minima.

00:18.221 --> 00:27.388
The figure shows the minima of this system changes over time as VD changes when a cyclical sequence of memories, memory 4 to 5, 6, 7 and then back to 4.

00:29.938 --> 00:37.975
Since VD is delayed VF, the cyclical sequence that is stored results in a system that is never in equilibrium, always transitioning to the next
