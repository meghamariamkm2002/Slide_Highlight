So let's first talk about our code structure model.
So in this model, the covariate will be history activities and treatment will be engagement with misinformation or information and outcome will be characters of the post in the future.
They can be fully described by the conditional intensity function.
But because, you know, function is continuous, so it is hard to quantify the effect on them.
So we apply a functional F to project the function to a vector.
And in this way, we can compare the functional with treatment and without treatment to acquire the individual treatment effect with finite dimensions.
