3035	6117	So let's first talk about our code structure model.
6577	20607	So in this model, the covariate will be history activities and treatment will be engagement with misinformation or information and outcome will be characters of the post in the future.
21047	25050	They can be fully described by the conditional intensity function.
25772	31758	But because, you know, function is continuous, so it is hard to quantify the effect on them.
32339	36984	So we apply a functional F to project the function to a vector.
37704	47755	And in this way, we can compare the functional with treatment and without treatment to acquire the individual treatment effect with finite dimensions.
