1616	3777	So first, let's talk about our motivation.
4578	17024	As many previous works pointed out, misinformation campaigns are manipulating public opinions on hotspot topics, such as COVID-19 epidemic and vaccines.
17585	28711	For example, a publication pointed out that in those places where misinformation from misinformation campaigns spread faster, the vaccination ratio of these places is also
29980	31961	relatively lower than other places.
33302	43347	So, to design mitigation strategies to reduce user susceptibility to misinformation, we have to understand how misinformation influence user beliefs and activities.
43947	49950	However, most of the existing works suffers from one or more of the following limitations.
50663	62327	So first, almost all the data-driven methodologies or data-driven analysis focus on correlation between misinformation and user activities.
62888	67950	And it is well known that causality is different from correlation.
68530	74072	So they cannot distinguish causal effect of misinformation from user prior beliefs.
75275	79136	Let us use the case of misinformation and the vaccination ratio.
79916	90839	One explanation could be that in this place, people primarily don't trust vaccines, so they don't take vaccines and they spread a lot of misinformation.
91359	96360	That could be true, but the correlation analysis cannot help us distinguish them.
97940	101981	And there are some other works trying to understand the real causal effect.
102674	106716	But they mainly rely on random controlled experiments and surveys.
107296	110518	So, first, they are very expensive.
110878	119002	And secondly, they may bring some ethical risk if we apply them on very huge social media platforms.
