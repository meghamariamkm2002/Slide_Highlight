2561	15684	And after defining the causal model, we can use the neural network to estimate the treatment effects by learning conditional intensity function with maximizing likelihood.
16605	29188	But here we may face a challenge, which is that the covariance could be correlated with the treatment because the platforms like Twitter, like Reddit,
29838	35085	they will recommend you with the content that they believe you are very likely to click on.
35766	38929	So the covariate will be correlated with treatment.
39871	48982	So to solve this issue, we propose an adversarial balanced neural temporal point process that can remove such kind of correlation with theoretical guarantees.
