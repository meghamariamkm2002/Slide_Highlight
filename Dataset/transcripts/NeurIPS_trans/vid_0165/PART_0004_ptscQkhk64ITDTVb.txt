And after defining the causal model, we can use the neural network to estimate the treatment effects by learning conditional intensity function with maximizing likelihood.
But here we may face a challenge, which is that the covariance could be correlated with the treatment because the platforms like Twitter, like Reddit,
they will recommend you with the content that they believe you are very likely to click on.
So the covariate will be correlated with treatment.
So to solve this issue, we propose an adversarial balanced neural temporal point process that can remove such kind of correlation with theoretical guarantees.
