00:01.509 --> 00:06.411
Here we quantify the performance of different NAS methods in our block search base.

00:07.111 --> 00:15.013
We measure the accuracy after reaching a fixed search cost of 40 and also we measure the cost required to achieve a good accuracy of 76.6.

00:17.194 --> 00:25.896
We can see that we can improve block wire NAS by utilizing reduced fine tuning proxy followed by full fine tuning and when a bad teacher is used it,

00:26.697 --> 00:31.080
we can improve the result by our proposed iterative strategy.
