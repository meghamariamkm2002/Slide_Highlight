models.

00:02.109 --> 00:14.952
This figure shows the accuracy of cell-based models from our search base, consisting of uniform blocks denoted in blue, and macro models consisting of different blocks denoted in red.

00:15.632 --> 00:18.893
Probable optimal points are additionally emphasised with markers.

00:19.773 --> 00:20.613
There are two highlights.

00:21.974 --> 00:27.735
First, the probability of frontier models with different blocks clearly dominate that of models with uniform blocks.

00:29.266 --> 00:34.002
2.

00:29.286 --> 00:34.002
The macro sphere is much larger, posting a challenge to the searching area.
