29	630	which is used.
2251	9919	We study if the predictor are good at estimating the end-to-end model accuracy after distillation and fine tuning.
11441	12422	There are three findings.
12982	22953	One, distillation loss and linear regression used in donor is better than change of validation accuracy and simple summation used in NANDER.
24276	28985	2.
24717	28985	Symmetry of blocks that were distributed for more epoch tend to produce better predictors.
29987	28985	3.
30568	35918	The juice and predictor, which does not require any distillation signatures, can outperform
