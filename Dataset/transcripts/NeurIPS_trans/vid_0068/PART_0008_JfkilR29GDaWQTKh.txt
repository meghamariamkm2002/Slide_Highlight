which is used.
We study if the predictor are good at estimating the end-to-end model accuracy after distillation and fine tuning.
There are three findings.
One, distillation loss and linear regression used in donor is better than change of validation accuracy and simple summation used in NANDER.
2.
Symmetry of blocks that were distributed for more epoch tend to produce better predictors.
3.
The juice and predictor, which does not require any distillation signatures, can outperform
