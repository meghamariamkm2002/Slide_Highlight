The focus of our paper is on the macro search space for neural architecture search.

00:06.633 --> 00:18.559
Now, traditional cell-based approach restricts the search to decide the operation and structure of a single block only, then the same block is tacked repeatedly to form an end-to-end model.

00:19.480 --> 00:25.464
macrosurface enables the individual search for each block in a DNN, leading to better performance.

00:26.084 --> 00:31.167
However, it is expensive because the subspace size grows exponentially with the number of blocks.

00:31.968 --> 00:42.995
To provide a systematic study of the performance of North's algorithm on a macrosurface, we release blocks to first large-scale benchmark and study of a macrosurface.
