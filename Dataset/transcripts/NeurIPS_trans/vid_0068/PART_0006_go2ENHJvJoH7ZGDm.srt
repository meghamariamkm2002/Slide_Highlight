from the teacher.

We asked several questions related to the performance model where they are fine-tuned in the block-by-setting compared to that when trained normally.

00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:16,255
From the result in this figure, we can see that in all cases, the student model is able to improve upon the teacher.

00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:25,958
However, when compared to the accuracy achievable when a student is trained normally, fine-tuning does not always result in improvement, especially when a teacher
