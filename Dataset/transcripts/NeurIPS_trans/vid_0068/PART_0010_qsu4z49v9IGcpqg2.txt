Here we quantify the performance of different NAS methods in our block search base.
We measure the accuracy after reaching a fixed search cost of 40 and also we measure the cost required to achieve a good accuracy of 76.6.
We can see that we can improve block wire NAS by utilizing reduced fine tuning proxy followed by full fine tuning and when a bad teacher is used it,
we can improve the result by our proposed iterative strategy.
