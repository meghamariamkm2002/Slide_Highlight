models.
This figure shows the accuracy of cell-based models from our search base, consisting of uniform blocks denoted in blue, and macro models consisting of different blocks denoted in red.
Probable optimal points are additionally emphasised with markers.
There are two highlights.
First, the probability of frontier models with different blocks clearly dominate that of models with uniform blocks.
2.
The macro sphere is much larger, posting a challenge to the searching area.
