1509	6411	Here we quantify the performance of different NAS methods in our block search base.
7111	15013	We measure the accuracy after reaching a fixed search cost of 40 and also we measure the cost required to achieve a good accuracy of 76.6.
17194	25896	We can see that we can improve block wire NAS by utilizing reduced fine tuning proxy followed by full fine tuning and when a bad teacher is used it,
26697	31080	we can improve the result by our proposed iterative strategy.
