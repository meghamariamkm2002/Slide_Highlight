from the teacher.
We asked several questions related to the performance model where they are fine-tuned in the block-by-setting compared to that when trained normally.
From the result in this figure, we can see that in all cases, the student model is able to improve upon the teacher.
However, when compared to the accuracy achievable when a student is trained normally, fine-tuning does not always result in improvement, especially when a teacher
