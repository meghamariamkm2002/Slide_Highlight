1010	6312	The focus of our paper is on the macro search space for neural architecture search.
6633	18559	Now, traditional cell-based approach restricts the search to decide the operation and structure of a single block only, then the same block is tacked repeatedly to form an end-to-end model.
19480	25464	macrosurface enables the individual search for each block in a DNN, leading to better performance.
26084	31167	However, it is expensive because the subspace size grows exponentially with the number of blocks.
31968	42995	To provide a systematic study of the performance of North's algorithm on a macrosurface, we release blocks to first large-scale benchmark and study of a macrosurface.
