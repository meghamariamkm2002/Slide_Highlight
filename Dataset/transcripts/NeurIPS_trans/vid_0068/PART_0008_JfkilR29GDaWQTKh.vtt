00:00.029 --> 00:00.630
which is used.

00:02.251 --> 00:09.919
We study if the predictor are good at estimating the end-to-end model accuracy after distillation and fine tuning.

00:11.441 --> 00:12.422
There are three findings.

00:12.982 --> 00:22.953
One, distillation loss and linear regression used in donor is better than change of validation accuracy and simple summation used in NANDER.

00:24.276 --> 00:28.985
2.

00:24.717 --> 00:28.985
Symmetry of blocks that were distributed for more epoch tend to produce better predictors.

00:29.987 --> 00:28.985
3.

00:30.568 --> 00:35.918
The juice and predictor, which does not require any distillation signatures, can outperform
