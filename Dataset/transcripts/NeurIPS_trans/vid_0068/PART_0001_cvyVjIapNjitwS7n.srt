The focus of our paper is on the macro search space for neural architecture search.

00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:18,559
Now, traditional cell-based approach restricts the search to decide the operation and structure of a single block only, then the same block is tacked repeatedly to form an end-to-end model.

macrosurface enables the individual search for each block in a DNN, leading to better performance.

00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:31,167
However, it is expensive because the subspace size grows exponentially with the number of blocks.

To provide a systematic study of the performance of North's algorithm on a macrosurface, we release blocks to first large-scale benchmark and study of a macrosurface.
