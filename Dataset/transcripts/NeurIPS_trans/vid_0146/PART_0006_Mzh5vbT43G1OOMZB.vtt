00:00.982 --> 00:09.309
Our tests employ three different types of vision transformers, vanilla VIT, date, and VIT with improved augmentations and regularization.

00:10.270 --> 00:14.354
We measure the increase in robustness to distribution sheets, i.e.

00:14.494 --> 00:17.656
the increase in accuracy for datasets with shifted distributions.

00:18.417 --> 00:21.920
We use adversarial, reward, and synthetic datasets.
