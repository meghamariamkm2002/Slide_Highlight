1033	9075	Unlike other methods, our method employs the losses during a short fine-tuning process on models that were already pre-trained on ImageNet.
10016	17418	We add a classification loss at classification to ensure that the accuracy of the models does not decrease due to the fine-tuning process.
18418	24800	The formulation of our classification loss is as follows, and it encourages the model to have high confidence on its predictions.
25970	32154	Thus, our final loss term is formulated as follows as a combination of the relevance and the classification loss.
