896	2998	Next, we present some qualitative results.
3758	9202	As you can see, the different models are able to correct the wrong predictions after applying their method.
9942	15546	For example, the model here predicts that this cool bus is a snowplow due to the presence of the snow in the background.
16347	23972	An additional example is this model that classifies the teddy bear as a ping pong ball due to a sports consideration of only its path.
24907	31876	In both cases, our method is able to correct the wrong predictions by allowing the model to focus on the correct parts of the image.
