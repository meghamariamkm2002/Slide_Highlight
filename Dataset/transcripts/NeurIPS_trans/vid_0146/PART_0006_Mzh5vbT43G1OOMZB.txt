Our tests employ three different types of vision transformers, vanilla VIT, date, and VIT with improved augmentations and regularization.
We measure the increase in robustness to distribution sheets, i.e.
the increase in accuracy for datasets with shifted distributions.
We use adversarial, reward, and synthetic datasets.
