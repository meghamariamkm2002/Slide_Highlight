1775	4876	First, let's describe the problem the paper tries to deal with.
5757	10238	It is a known fact that vision models tend to rely on spurious cues to make their predictions.
11419	17501	In this work, we examine the spurious cues used by vision transformers and find that they suffer from two main issues.
18362	24864	The first is overreliance on the image background, and the second is a sparse consideration of the foreground pixels.
25865	28306	The figure here represents examples of both cases.
29130	40176	For example, the image here is classified by the model as a chestnut with a confidence of 100%, but the saliency map shows that the model used only the background to make its prediction.
41577	45979	This can lead to lack of robustness to distribution shifts and poor generalization.
46759	49521	We ask ourselves, can we correct the model's logic?
