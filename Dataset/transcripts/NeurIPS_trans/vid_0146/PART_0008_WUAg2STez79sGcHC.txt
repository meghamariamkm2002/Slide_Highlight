Next, we present some qualitative results.
As you can see, the different models are able to correct the wrong predictions after applying their method.
For example, the model here predicts that this cool bus is a snowplow due to the presence of the snow in the background.
An additional example is this model that classifies the teddy bear as a ping pong ball due to a sports consideration of only its path.
In both cases, our method is able to correct the wrong predictions by allowing the model to focus on the correct parts of the image.
