Now, let's describe the method.

00:03.302 --> 00:12.405
We propose to manipulate the explainability maps of the model directly, to ensure that the model avoids using spurious correlations in the background and in the foreground of the image.

00:13.305 --> 00:18.187
Our main loss is comprised of two loss functions, L background and L foreground.

00:19.107 --> 00:25.329
L background prevents the model from over-interpreting the background by demanding that the relevance on the background is close to zero.

00:26.260 --> 00:33.872
The foreground encourages the model to use as much as the foreground as possible by encouraging the relevance on the foreground to be close to one.
