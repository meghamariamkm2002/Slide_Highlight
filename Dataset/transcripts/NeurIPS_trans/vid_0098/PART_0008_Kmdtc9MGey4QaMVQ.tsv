209	3892	We use the ultra-fast lane detection method as a backbone for lane detection.
4593	6715	The following UDA methods are evaluated.
7155	10558	Done, ADA, SKADA and our SGPCS.
11319	17865	To work with UFLD, the UDA methods had to be adapted for grid-based lane detection, which is not always a trivial task.
18760	25707	As can be seen on the right-side figure, grid-based lane detection divides the image into grid cells and classifies different lane types.
26548	29111	Results are given as an average over five runs.
29712	32995	Baselines, implementations and weights are publicly available.
