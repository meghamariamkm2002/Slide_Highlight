Our method can be seen in the upper figure.
Features of the source and target domain are aligned by cluster prototypes.
To cluster memory bank features into prototypes, we build upon PCS and perform spherical k-means with a momentum of 0.5.
Similar to PCS, we perform in-domain contrastive learning and cross-domain self-supervised learning between the features of the feature extractor and the prototypes.
To further improve performance, we add our pseudo-loss formulation for grid-based lane detection.
Overall, our objective function comprises the in-domain and cross-domain losses from PCS, all losses from UFLD and all
