00:00.209 --> 00:03.892
We use the ultra-fast lane detection method as a backbone for lane detection.

00:04.593 --> 00:06.715
The following UDA methods are evaluated.

00:07.155 --> 00:10.558
Done, ADA, SKADA and our SGPCS.

00:11.319 --> 00:17.865
To work with UFLD, the UDA methods had to be adapted for grid-based lane detection, which is not always a trivial task.

00:18.760 --> 00:25.707
As can be seen on the right-side figure, grid-based lane detection divides the image into grid cells and classifies different lane types.

00:26.548 --> 00:29.111
Results are given as an average over five runs.

00:29.712 --> 00:32.995
Baselines, implementations and weights are publicly available.
