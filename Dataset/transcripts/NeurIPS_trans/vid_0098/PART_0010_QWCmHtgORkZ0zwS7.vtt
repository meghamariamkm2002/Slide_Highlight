00:01.030 --> 00:09.634
In our experiments, the evaluated UDA methods achieved a maximum accuracy gain of around 4% and high positives and negative rates.

00:10.435 --> 00:15.978
This shows that the methods are not able to achieve comparable results to the supervised baselines.

00:16.778 --> 00:23.705
Furthermore, we observe force-positive and force-negative rates increase significantly on the multi-target task of Moulin.

00:24.246 --> 00:32.995
We want to emphasize that force-positive and force-negatives represent strongly detected and missing lanes, which can lead to crucial impacts on autonomous driving.
