We used the open source color simulator to collect data for our source domains.
During the data collection process, we randomized multiple aspects of the agent and environment.
A comparison of agent and environmental variations to other private unit data sets for land detection can be seen in the table on the slide.
Please note that none of the other data sets is publicly available at
