00:00.370 --> 00:06.887
To summarize, we proposed car lane, the first three ways seem to real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection.

00:07.742 --> 00:15.526
The current difficulties of examined UDAR methods to align the source and target domains confirm the need for the proposed car lane benchmark.

00:16.206 --> 00:20.449
UDAR methods should be tested with care and under the right conditions on a full-scale car.

00:20.989 --> 00:26.532
However, we were testing in the model vehicle domain can be carried out in a safe and controlled environment.

00:27.332 --> 00:32.335
We believe that car lane eases the development and comparison of UDAR methods for lane detection.
