00:00.829 --> 00:02.690
Our method can be seen in the upper figure.

00:03.390 --> 00:06.772
Features of the source and target domain are aligned by cluster prototypes.

00:07.592 --> 00:15.055
To cluster memory bank features into prototypes, we build upon PCS and perform spherical k-means with a momentum of 0.5.

00:16.562 --> 00:25.190
Similar to PCS, we perform in-domain contrastive learning and cross-domain self-supervised learning between the features of the feature extractor and the prototypes.

00:25.850 --> 00:30.675
To further improve performance, we add our pseudo-loss formulation for grid-based lane detection.

00:31.655 --> 00:38.562
Overall, our objective function comprises the in-domain and cross-domain losses from PCS, all losses from UFLD and all
