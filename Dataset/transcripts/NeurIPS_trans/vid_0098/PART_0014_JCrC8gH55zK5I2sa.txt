To summarize, we proposed car lane, the first three ways seem to real domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection.
The current difficulties of examined UDAR methods to align the source and target domains confirm the need for the proposed car lane benchmark.
UDAR methods should be tested with care and under the right conditions on a full-scale car.
However, we were testing in the model vehicle domain can be carried out in a safe and controlled environment.
We believe that car lane eases the development and comparison of UDAR methods for lane detection.
