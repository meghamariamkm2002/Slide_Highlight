829	2690	Our method can be seen in the upper figure.
3390	6772	Features of the source and target domain are aligned by cluster prototypes.
7592	15055	To cluster memory bank features into prototypes, we build upon PCS and perform spherical k-means with a momentum of 0.5.
16562	25190	Similar to PCS, we perform in-domain contrastive learning and cross-domain self-supervised learning between the features of the feature extractor and the prototypes.
25850	30675	To further improve performance, we add our pseudo-loss formulation for grid-based lane detection.
31655	38562	Overall, our objective function comprises the in-domain and cross-domain losses from PCS, all losses from UFLD and all
