First of all, I would like to introduce the motivation of our work.

00:07.543 --> 00:17.208
As we all know, animal pose estimation is crucial in animal behavior understanding and wildlife conservation.

00:17.708 --> 00:21.650
But animal pose estimation data sets are largely ignored.

00:22.131 --> 00:24.212
And existing data sets

00:25.117 --> 00:31.347
You really don't have continuous time information or lake detailed keypoint annotations.
