00:00.600 --> 00:12.903
Then regarding the diverse animal species in the real world, we think it is essential to evaluate the interspecies generalization ability of animal pose estimation models.

00:13.563 --> 00:23.266
In each experiment, all the instants from a specific family follow the test set, while those instants belong to other families are used for training.

00:23.946 --> 00:33.177
And we can find that the model generalizes well on animal species, where there are similarities between training and test species.

00:33.738 --> 00:36.702
And for others, the model doesn't generalize well.
