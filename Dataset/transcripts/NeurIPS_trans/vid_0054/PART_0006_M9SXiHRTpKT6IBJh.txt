First, in single-frame animal pose estimations, we benchmark simple baseline HRNet, HRFormer, and VIT pose method.
We set up three settings to benchmark their performance, including user network weights per trend on ImageNet, Cocoa, and AP10000 dataset.
With human pose per training, both scene-based and vision-transformer
These methods show performance gains.
Besides, the benefit of using AP1000 for pre-training is less than that of using the human post data set for pre-training.
We suspect that it is caused by differences of distribution and data source and as well as the scale differences.
