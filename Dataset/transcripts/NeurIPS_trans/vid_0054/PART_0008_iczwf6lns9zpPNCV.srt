00:00:00,683 --> 00:00:07,806
And to further evaporate the model's generalization ability, we carried out the experiment under the field-short setting.

2
00:00:08,487 --> 00:00:22,213
And we can find that with more data for training, the performance is greatly improved, especially on species with unique texture appearance and posture characteristics.

3
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:28,476
And we think it's because these unique characteristics are not shared in other species.
