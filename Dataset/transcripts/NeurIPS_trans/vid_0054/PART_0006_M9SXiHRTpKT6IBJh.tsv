689	10472	First, in single-frame animal pose estimations, we benchmark simple baseline HRNet, HRFormer, and VIT pose method.
11132	21915	We set up three settings to benchmark their performance, including user network weights per trend on ImageNet, Cocoa, and AP10000 dataset.
22455	26716	With human pose per training, both scene-based and vision-transformer
27296	29499	These methods show performance gains.
29999	38789	Besides, the benefit of using AP1000 for pre-training is less than that of using the human post data set for pre-training.
39390	48801	We suspect that it is caused by differences of distribution and data source and as well as the scale differences.
