Then regarding the diverse animal species in the real world, we think it is essential to evaluate the interspecies generalization ability of animal pose estimation models.
In each experiment, all the instants from a specific family follow the test set, while those instants belong to other families are used for training.
And we can find that the model generalizes well on animal species, where there are similarities between training and test species.
And for others, the model doesn't generalize well.
