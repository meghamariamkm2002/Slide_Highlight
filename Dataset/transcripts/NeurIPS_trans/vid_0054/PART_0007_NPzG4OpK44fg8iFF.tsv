600	12903	Then regarding the diverse animal species in the real world, we think it is essential to evaluate the interspecies generalization ability of animal pose estimation models.
13563	23266	In each experiment, all the instants from a specific family follow the test set, while those instants belong to other families are used for training.
23946	33177	And we can find that the model generalizes well on animal species, where there are similarities between training and test species.
33738	36702	And for others, the model doesn't generalize well.
