00:01.790 --> 00:05.592
These are very different from traditional bidders who are utility maximizers.

00:05.992 --> 00:10.714
They want to maximize their expected utility, which is the difference between the value and the payment.

00:11.415 --> 00:15.677
And they don't care about the value, the ratio between value and payment.

00:16.698 --> 00:19.019
So we understand these bidders quite well.

00:19.199 --> 00:26.803
We have many maxims for them, like Meyerson's, VCG, hosted pricing, and others.

00:27.603 --> 00:28.664
They are well studied.

00:29.344 --> 00:32.225
On the other hand, for alibiders, we don't know so much.

00:33.826 --> 00:43.711
Alibiders want to maximize their expected value, subject to the ROI constraint, which means the ratio between the expected value and the expected payment should be large enough.

00:44.731 --> 00:46.272
We do have some maxims for them.

00:47.232 --> 00:52.815
These maxims involve payment scalers, and sometimes we do prior-free approximations.
