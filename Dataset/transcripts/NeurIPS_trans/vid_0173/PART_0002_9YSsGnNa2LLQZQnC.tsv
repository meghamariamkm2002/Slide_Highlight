1790	5592	These are very different from traditional bidders who are utility maximizers.
5992	10714	They want to maximize their expected utility, which is the difference between the value and the payment.
11415	15677	And they don't care about the value, the ratio between value and payment.
16698	19019	So we understand these bidders quite well.
19199	26803	We have many maxims for them, like Meyerson's, VCG, hosted pricing, and others.
27603	28664	They are well studied.
29344	32225	On the other hand, for alibiders, we don't know so much.
33826	43711	Alibiders want to maximize their expected value, subject to the ROI constraint, which means the ratio between the expected value and the expected payment should be large enough.
44731	46272	We do have some maxims for them.
47232	52815	These maxims involve payment scalers, and sometimes we do prior-free approximations.
