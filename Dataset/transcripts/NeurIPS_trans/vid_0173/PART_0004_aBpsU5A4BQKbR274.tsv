1009	10132	which make them kind of infeasible for real world out of the options because in practice we really want options to be simple and robust.
11012	20295	So they are easy for users to understand and they are easy for the standard to compute and they can tolerate inaccurate priors.
22288	34011	In this talk, we give a constant approximation posted price maximum, which is both simple and robust for alibiders who are value maximizing subject to RI constraints.
35332	42093	To complement this result, we show that there is a non-trivial lower bound for posted price maximums with alibiders.
42714	47755	And as bi-products, we also give results about dynamic auctions and combinatorial auctions
