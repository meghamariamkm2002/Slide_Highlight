1411	14715	So in this paper, we consider the setting of quantum zero sum games, where players are playing using density matrices, which are positive semi-definite matrices with the trace sum summing up to one, instead of classical probability distributions.
15495	29919	Now in this setting, there is a matrix extension of the standard MWU or multiplicative weights update algorithm, which is known as matrix MWU or MMWU, and it is used for online learning in this setting of quantum games.
31218	37408	Now MMW is known to converge in a time average sense to approximate Nash equilibria in these quantum zero sum capes.
38459	56351	However, in the classical setting, it has been shown that MWU does not converge to the Nash equilibrium, as well as the fact that the continuous time version of MWU, which is known as replicator dynamics, exhibits a weaker form of periodicity known as Poincaré recurrence.
57672	65878	When we say Poincaré recurrence, we mean that for an infinitely long time scale, the trajectories will return infinitely often to the initial condition.
67202	72825	So these are two key results which are not present in the literature for quantum games.
73365	78168	Thus, our key question and key thrust of this paper is to answer these two questions.
78528	82130	First, how does MMW behave in the last iterate sense?
82611	83451	Does it diverge?
83471	84912	Does it converge to Nash equilibrium?
85572	95978	Secondly, do classical results like Poincare recurrence hold in a continuous time limit for the quantum version of replicator dynamics in the setting
