the dynamics.
Some of the key takeaways from our work, we show an initial step towards analyzing learning behavior in games with quantum information.
And the recurrence result also encourages novel discretization methods, which preserve the connection to volume conservation.
In terms of future work, we intend to extend the recurrence and conversion results to multi-agent quantum games, as well as formalize the quantum setting for different classes of classical games, for example, potential games.
That concludes my talk.
Thank you.
