389	3454	version of MMWU which we call quantum replicated dynamics.
4154	16491	So in the paper we define quantum replicated dynamics by taking the continuous time limit of MMWU and we analyze it to show this following theorem that quantum replicated dynamics are Poincar√© recurrent in any two player quantum zero sum game.
16631	18193	It's a fully mixed Nash equilibrium.
19088	26392	So to give a visual example of what recurrence looks like, imagine if the agents are red and blue represented on the block sphere here.
26412	34076	The block sphere is a representation of a two-dimensional density matrix and a two by two density matrix.
35016	40059	And the idea here is that we want, and given that the red and blue agents are initialized in the center,
41155	45218	recurrent states that they should return infinitely often to the center point.
45658	49701	And as you can see here, to the origin, as you can see here, they indeed do that.
49721	56906	They start oscillating back and forth in these straight line patterns, but they do return to the origin often if you keep running the algorithm.
57881	60182	So how do we prove recurrence in a classical setting?
61083	65646	It is needed to prove first that the orbits are bounded, and second, some notion of volume is conserved.
66146	75292	However, the classical setting or the classical strategy, I should say, fails in this case due to the non-commutativity of the terms in the quantum replicated dynamics.
75892	82256	So we use a transformation to a novel space and show that orbits are bounded and volume is conserved in this space.
82776	85998	And this then helps us to prove recurrence for the quantum replicated
