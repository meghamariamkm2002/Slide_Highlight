the dynamics.

00:02.050 --> 00:08.993
Some of the key takeaways from our work, we show an initial step towards analyzing learning behavior in games with quantum information.

00:09.833 --> 00:16.256
And the recurrence result also encourages novel discretization methods, which preserve the connection to volume conservation.

00:17.717 --> 00:29.282
In terms of future work, we intend to extend the recurrence and conversion results to multi-agent quantum games, as well as formalize the quantum setting for different classes of classical games, for example, potential games.

That concludes my talk.

00:31.003 --> 00:31.307
Thank you.
