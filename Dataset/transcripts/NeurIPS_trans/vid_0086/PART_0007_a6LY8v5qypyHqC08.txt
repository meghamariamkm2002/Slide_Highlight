For base lines, we use T5 and T5 bischema serialization, and then we use three threshold methods to evaluate how well each method can distinguish between answerable and unanswerable questions.
The methods include no threshold based on clustering boundary, threshold based on percentile.
For more details, please refer to our paper.
