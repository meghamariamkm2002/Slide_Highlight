Trustworthy Semantic Parsing is a new test that we propose to evaluate text-to-escalant models under the practical challenges mentioned in the previous slides.

2
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:17,923
In Trustworthy Semantic Parsing, the model should only answer answerable questions and refuse to answer if they are unanswerable.

3
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:29,010
Because the answer from the EHR database may be directly used for clinical decision making, the model should have a strategy to predict whether it can confidently answer the question or not.

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,033
We use two metrics here to measure the performance of this task.

5
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:35,756
F1 answer and effort execution.

6
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:42,101
Effort answer measures how well the model distinguishes between answerable and unanswerable questions.

7
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,803
F1 execution is a more strict metric.

00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:46,945
It only counts when the retrieved answer
