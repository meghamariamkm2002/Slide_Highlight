To construct a dataset for such systems, we collaborated with the Ganyang University Hospital and asked people what questions they would ask an AI speaker for information stored in the EHR tables.

00:13.841 --> 00:21.446
After the poll, we templatized the questions and filtered out the ones that are not compatible with Mimic 3 and EICU schemas.

00:22.366 --> 00:26.289
The compatible questions were labeled with the corresponding SQL queries.

00:26.849 --> 00:29.931
The incompatible ones were considered unanswerable questions.
