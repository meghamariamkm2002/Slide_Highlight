To construct a dataset for such systems, we collaborated with the Ganyang University Hospital and asked people what questions they would ask an AI speaker for information stored in the EHR tables.

00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:21,446
After the poll, we templatized the questions and filtered out the ones that are not compatible with Mimic 3 and EICU schemas.

00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:26,289
The compatible questions were labeled with the corresponding SQL queries.

4
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:29,931
The incompatible ones were considered unanswerable questions.
