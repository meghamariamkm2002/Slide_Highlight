2172	9280	The EHR SQL dataset consists of 24,000 questions to SQL pairs, frequently asked on structured EHR data.
10410	23835	The questions were collected from a poll conducted at a university hospital and more than 200 hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, insurance review staff, infection control staff, and more participated in the poll.
24716	30658	The label SQL queries are linked to two open source EHR databases, Mimic 3 and EICU.
31621	39206	The unique challenges of the dataset are, first, we have a wide range of real-world questions frequently asked on structured EHR data.
39987	53276	From retrieving a patient's test results, to summing of a patient's total hospital cost, and calculating the survival rate of a certain group of patients, the questions in the dataset reflect the diverse needs of staff in the hospital.
55074	57635	Second, time is very important in healthcare.
58115	64498	To reflect that, we templatize time and combine them with the questions to make the data set more realistic.
65418	69800	Lastly, we have unanswerable questions that were collected together from the poll.
70480	76023	The questions were unanswerable because they were either ambiguous or went beyond the database schemas.
76843	81745	These questions are later used to test the trustworthiness of text to SQL models.
