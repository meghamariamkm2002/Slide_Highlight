Trustworthy Semantic Parsing is a new test that we propose to evaluate text-to-escalant models under the practical challenges mentioned in the previous slides.

00:10.898 --> 00:17.923
In Trustworthy Semantic Parsing, the model should only answer answerable questions and refuse to answer if they are unanswerable.

00:18.581 --> 00:29.010
Because the answer from the EHR database may be directly used for clinical decision making, the model should have a strategy to predict whether it can confidently answer the question or not.

00:29.670 --> 00:33.033
We use two metrics here to measure the performance of this task.

00:33.654 --> 00:35.756
F1 answer and effort execution.

00:36.396 --> 00:42.101
Effort answer measures how well the model distinguishes between answerable and unanswerable questions.

00:42.741 --> 00:44.803
F1 execution is a more strict metric.

00:45.264 --> 00:46.945
It only counts when the retrieved answer
