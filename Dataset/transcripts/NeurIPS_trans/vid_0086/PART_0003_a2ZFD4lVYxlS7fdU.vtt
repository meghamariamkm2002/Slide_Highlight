Meanwhile, most hospital staff interact with the EHR database with predefined rule conversion systems.

00:08.508 --> 00:16.931
This means extending or modifying the systems requires special training, and this is a huge bottleneck for them to freely utilize the database.

00:17.995 --> 00:24.621
One alternative way is to build a system that can directly translate a natural language question into a SQL query.

00:25.501 --> 00:33.648
With this system, the users can simply type or verbally ask their questions, and the system will return the answers from the database.

00:34.689 --> 00:38.312
Imagine an AI speaker that answers questions on EHR data.

00:38.972 --> 00:45.718
This will unleash the potential of EHR data, and anyone in the hospital can easily access the information they want.
