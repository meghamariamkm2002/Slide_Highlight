possible extensions to this work are one can develop a new class of semantic parsing models that can handle unanswerable questions.
The data set itself can be extended to interactive and conversational settings.
And this is a great starting point for creating multi-modal EHRQA data sets.
Our data set is currently available on GitHub, and their leaderboard can be found in this link.
Thank you for listening.
