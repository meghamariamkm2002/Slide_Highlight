Trustworthy Semantic Parsing is a new test that we propose to evaluate text-to-escalant models under the practical challenges mentioned in the previous slides.
In Trustworthy Semantic Parsing, the model should only answer answerable questions and refuse to answer if they are unanswerable.
Because the answer from the EHR database may be directly used for clinical decision making, the model should have a strategy to predict whether it can confidently answer the question or not.
We use two metrics here to measure the performance of this task.
F1 answer and effort execution.
Effort answer measures how well the model distinguishes between answerable and unanswerable questions.
F1 execution is a more strict metric.
It only counts when the retrieved answer
