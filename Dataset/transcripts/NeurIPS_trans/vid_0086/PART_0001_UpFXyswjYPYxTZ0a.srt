00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:09,280
The EHR SQL dataset consists of 24,000 questions to SQL pairs, frequently asked on structured EHR data.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:23,835
The questions were collected from a poll conducted at a university hospital and more than 200 hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, insurance review staff, infection control staff, and more participated in the poll.

3
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:30,658
The label SQL queries are linked to two open source EHR databases, Mimic 3 and EICU.

4
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:39,206
The unique challenges of the dataset are, first, we have a wide range of real-world questions frequently asked on structured EHR data.

5
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:53,276
From retrieving a patient's test results, to summing of a patient's total hospital cost, and calculating the survival rate of a certain group of patients, the questions in the dataset reflect the diverse needs of staff in the hospital.

6
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:57,635
Second, time is very important in healthcare.

7
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:04,498
To reflect that, we templatize time and combine them with the questions to make the data set more realistic.

8
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:09,800
Lastly, we have unanswerable questions that were collected together from the poll.

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,023
The questions were unanswerable because they were either ambiguous or went beyond the database schemas.

10
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,745
These questions are later used to test the trustworthiness of text to SQL models.
