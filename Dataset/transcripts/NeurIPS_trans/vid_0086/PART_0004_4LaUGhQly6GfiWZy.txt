To construct a dataset for such systems, we collaborated with the Ganyang University Hospital and asked people what questions they would ask an AI speaker for information stored in the EHR tables.
After the poll, we templatized the questions and filtered out the ones that are not compatible with Mimic 3 and EICU schemas.
The compatible questions were labeled with the corresponding SQL queries.
The incompatible ones were considered unanswerable questions.
