Meanwhile, most hospital staff interact with the EHR database with predefined rule conversion systems.
This means extending or modifying the systems requires special training, and this is a huge bottleneck for them to freely utilize the database.
One alternative way is to build a system that can directly translate a natural language question into a SQL query.
With this system, the users can simply type or verbally ask their questions, and the system will return the answers from the database.
Imagine an AI speaker that answers questions on EHR data.
This will unleash the potential of EHR data, and anyone in the hospital can easily access the information they want.
