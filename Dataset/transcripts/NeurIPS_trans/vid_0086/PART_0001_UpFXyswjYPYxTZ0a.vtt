The EHR SQL dataset consists of 24,000 questions to SQL pairs, frequently asked on structured EHR data.

00:10.410 --> 00:23.835
The questions were collected from a poll conducted at a university hospital and more than 200 hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, insurance review staff, infection control staff, and more participated in the poll.

00:24.716 --> 00:30.658
The label SQL queries are linked to two open source EHR databases, Mimic 3 and EICU.

00:31.621 --> 00:39.206
The unique challenges of the dataset are, first, we have a wide range of real-world questions frequently asked on structured EHR data.

00:39.987 --> 00:53.276
From retrieving a patient's test results, to summing of a patient's total hospital cost, and calculating the survival rate of a certain group of patients, the questions in the dataset reflect the diverse needs of staff in the hospital.

00:55.074 --> 00:57.635
Second, time is very important in healthcare.

00:58.115 --> 01:04.498
To reflect that, we templatize time and combine them with the questions to make the data set more realistic.

01:05.418 --> 01:09.800
Lastly, we have unanswerable questions that were collected together from the poll.

01:10.480 --> 01:16.023
The questions were unanswerable because they were either ambiguous or went beyond the database schemas.

01:16.843 --> 01:21.745
These questions are later used to test the trustworthiness of text to SQL models.
