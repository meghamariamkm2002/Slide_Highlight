Here we present two cases in which we correctly identify the native pocket, where previous method cannot.
In conclusion, we build the first intermolecular trigonometry-aware neural network for the production of protein-drug interaction.
And we also achieved a soda result in both binding structure production and binding affinity production.
In the future, we will explicitly model the protein dynamics because proteins are intrinsically dynamic.
And we will also incorporate a larger amount binding affinity data because we have much more affinity data than structured data.
