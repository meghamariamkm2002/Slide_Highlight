little more about our intermolecular trigonometry module.
For interaction between i and j, they are updated by every edge coming from i and every edge coming from node j. And they are updated together in a very efficient way.
And the interaction energy landscape is smoother than traditional scoring functions because they move beyond the pairwise interaction.
And the energy landscape is more accurate than traditional machine learning methods because we explicitly model the triangle inequality series.
