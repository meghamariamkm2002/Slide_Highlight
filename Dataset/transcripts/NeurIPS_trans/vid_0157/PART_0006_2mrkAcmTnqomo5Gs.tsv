1940	10184	Here we present two cases in which we correctly identify the native pocket, where previous method cannot.
12505	21549	In conclusion, we build the first intermolecular trigonometry-aware neural network for the production of protein-drug interaction.
22569	29172	And we also achieved a soda result in both binding structure production and binding affinity production.
30714	39101	In the future, we will explicitly model the protein dynamics because proteins are intrinsically dynamic.
40002	49390	And we will also incorporate a larger amount binding affinity data because we have much more affinity data than structured data.
