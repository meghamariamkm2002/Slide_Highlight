2871	8894	For modern drug discovery, a commonly used approach is structure-based drug design.
9694	21401	And a key problem in structure-based drug design is to predict whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to the target protein and how it will bind.
22560	33647	This is an extremely challenging problem because the structure of proteins and drug molecules are measured in unit of Armstrong, 0.1 nanometer.
34787	38549	They are so small that are invisible to the naked eyes.
39570	47995	Sophisticated experiments have to be built to determine their structures and to study their dynamics is even harder.
