00:00:02,691 --> 00:00:08,496
Traditional approach to study the interaction between protein and organs is through darking.

2
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:15,301
Darking method typically consists of two components, scoring and sampling.

3
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:27,511
For each confirmation, a score will be assigned, and based on this score, they will propose new confirmation, and they do it iteratively.

4
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:34,801
Tankpan, however, combines both scoring and sampling into a single neural network.

5
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:42,086
Therefore, we are able to predict the final confirmation in a single shot.

6
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:48,041
We want to highlight two key innovations inside TankBank.

7
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:53,604
First, we create an intermolecular trigonometry module.

8
00:00:54,705 --> 00:01:10,714
That is, for node i and j, the interaction between them is modulated by the interaction between node i and k and the interaction between j and k simultaneously to account for the many-body effect.

9
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:32,915
second, we extract information from the whole protein instead of the binding pocket, because proteins typically have many bulkhead pockets, and the crystal structure tells us that the rodent bind to the native pocket is stronger than to other
