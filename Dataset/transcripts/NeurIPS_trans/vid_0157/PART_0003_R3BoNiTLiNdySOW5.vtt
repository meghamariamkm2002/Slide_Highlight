little more about our intermolecular trigonometry module.

00:06.710 --> 00:22.985
For interaction between i and j, they are updated by every edge coming from i and every edge coming from node j. And they are updated together in a very efficient way.

00:24.335 --> 00:35.538
And the interaction energy landscape is smoother than traditional scoring functions because they move beyond the pairwise interaction.

00:36.779 --> 00:48.962
And the energy landscape is more accurate than traditional machine learning methods because we explicitly model the triangle inequality series.
