Hello, thanks for watching.

00:06.829 --> 00:14.633
Today we are presenting tank band, trigonometry-aware neural networks for drug protein binding structure prediction.

00:15.733 --> 00:18.054
Please take a look of our cartoon here.

00:18.915 --> 00:25.958
The problem we are trying to solve is to predict how a small molecule will bind to the target
