protein.
For modern drug discovery, a commonly used approach is structure-based drug design.
And a key problem in structure-based drug design is to predict whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to the target protein and how it will bind.
This is an extremely challenging problem because the structure of proteins and drug molecules are measured in unit of Armstrong, 0.1 nanometer.
They are so small that are invisible to the naked eyes.
Sophisticated experiments have to be built to determine their structures and to study their dynamics is even harder.
