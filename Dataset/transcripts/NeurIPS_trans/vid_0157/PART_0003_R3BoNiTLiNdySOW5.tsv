1966	5489	little more about our intermolecular trigonometry module.
6710	22985	For interaction between i and j, they are updated by every edge coming from i and every edge coming from node j. And they are updated together in a very efficient way.
24335	35538	And the interaction energy landscape is smoother than traditional scoring functions because they move beyond the pairwise interaction.
36779	48962	And the energy landscape is more accurate than traditional machine learning methods because we explicitly model the triangle inequality series.
