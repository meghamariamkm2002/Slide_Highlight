00:01.940 --> 00:10.184
Here we present two cases in which we correctly identify the native pocket, where previous method cannot.

00:12.505 --> 00:21.549
In conclusion, we build the first intermolecular trigonometry-aware neural network for the production of protein-drug interaction.

00:22.569 --> 00:29.172
And we also achieved a soda result in both binding structure production and binding affinity production.

00:30.714 --> 00:39.101
In the future, we will explicitly model the protein dynamics because proteins are intrinsically dynamic.

00:40.002 --> 00:49.390
And we will also incorporate a larger amount binding affinity data because we have much more affinity data than structured data.
