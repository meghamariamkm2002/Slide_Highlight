protein.

For modern drug discovery, a commonly used approach is structure-based drug design.

00:09.694 --> 00:21.401
And a key problem in structure-based drug design is to predict whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to the target protein and how it will bind.

00:22.560 --> 00:33.647
This is an extremely challenging problem because the structure of proteins and drug molecules are measured in unit of Armstrong, 0.1 nanometer.

00:34.787 --> 00:38.549
They are so small that are invisible to the naked eyes.

00:39.570 --> 00:47.995
Sophisticated experiments have to be built to determine their structures and to study their dynamics is even harder.
