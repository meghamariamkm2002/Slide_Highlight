00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:06,053
The general sequential episodic memory model, or GSEMM, deals with these two limitations.

00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:11,597
We derive GSEMM by introducing asymmetric synapses with signal propagation delays in the GAMM.

00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:19,002
The asymmetric synapses result in the temporal behavior of the model and the delay stabilizes individual memories over time.
