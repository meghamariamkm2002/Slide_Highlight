1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:06,752
However, even if there exist meaningful patterns in the training data, the DNN may still not learn these concepts.

2
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:12,554
A typical example is when the task can be conducted with some shortcut solutions.

3
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:20,118
In this case, the DNN probably converges to the shortcut solution, without encoding complex concepts.
