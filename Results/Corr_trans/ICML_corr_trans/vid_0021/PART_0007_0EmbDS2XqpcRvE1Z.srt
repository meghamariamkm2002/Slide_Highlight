00:00:00,842 --> 00:00:09,147
In the state-only or LFO setting, we compare against Apollo, once again using only a single extra trajectory, and importantly, CFO uses identical hyperparameters as the pre-rate setting.

00:00:09,767 --> 00:00:16,591
The figure shows two versions of CFO compared with Apollo, one estimating the next state distribution and the other limiting itself to the single state distribution.

00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:22,835
Both incarnations of CFO distinctly outperform the LFO-tailored Apollo on every imitation learning metric.
