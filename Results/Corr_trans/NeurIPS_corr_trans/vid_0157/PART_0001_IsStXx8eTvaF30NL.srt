protein.

For modern drug discovery, a commonly used approach is structure-based drug design (SBDD).

3
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:21,401
And a key problem in structure-based drug design is to predict whether a candidate drug molecule will bind to the target protein and how it will interact with it.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:33,647
This is an extremely challenging problem because the structure of proteins and drug molecules are measured in unit of Angstrom, 0.1 nanometer.

00:00:34,787 --> 00:00:38,549
They are so small that they are invisible to the naked eyes.

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:47,995
Sophisticated experiments have to be built to determine their structures and to study their dynamics is even harder.
