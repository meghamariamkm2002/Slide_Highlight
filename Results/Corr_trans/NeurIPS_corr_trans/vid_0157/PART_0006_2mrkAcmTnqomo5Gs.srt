1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:10,184
Here we present two cases in which we correctly identify the native pocket, where previous methods cannot.

2
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:21,549
In conclusion, we built the first inter-molecular trigonometry-aware neural network for the prediction of protein-drug interaction.

3
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:29,172
And we also achieved a state-of-the-art result in both binding structure production and binding affinity prediction in PDBbind dataset.

4
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:39,101
In the future, we will explicitly model the protein dynamics. Because proteins are intrinsically dynamic.

5
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:49,390
And we will also incorporate a larger amount of binding affinity data because we have much more affinity data than structured data.
