the dynamics.

00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:08,993
Some of the key takeaways from our work, we show an initial step towards analyzing learning behavior in games with quantum information.

00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:16,256
And the recurrence result also encourages novel discretization methods, which preserve the connection to volume preservation.

00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:29,282
In terms of future work, we intend to extend the recurrence and convergence results to multi-agent quantum games, as well as formalize the quantum setting for different classes of classical games, for example, potential games.

That concludes my talk.

Thank you.
