zero sum quantum games.

So in terms of MMWU, we consider the quantum relative entropy between density matrices ρ and σ, which is given by the trace of ρ times log(ρ) minus log(σ). In this setting, the matrix MWU algorithm is simply a matrix extension, where you play using density matrices instead of classical

classical probability distributions.

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,443
And in this setting, we have the following main theorem.

5
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:37,180
When using MMWU, the rate of change in the sum of quantum relative entropies between the Nash equilibrium and the player strategies in a two-player zero-sum quantum game tends to zero when the step size mu goes to zero.

6
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:47,139
This means essentially that when agents are using MMWU, there's some notion or some notion of volume which is essentially conserved.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,005
And we use this fact and use this result to study the continuous-time
