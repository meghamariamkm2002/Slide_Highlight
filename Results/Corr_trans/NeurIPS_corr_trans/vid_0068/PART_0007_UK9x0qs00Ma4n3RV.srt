used.

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,231
Motor exhibits vastly different performance when distributed compared to normal training.

3
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:14,613
We scale up our analysis to a thousand random student networks which are distributed with good and bad teachers respectively.

4
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:19,214
Then we coordinate their training from scratch accuracy to the fine-tuning accuracy.

5
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:22,995
We see that fine-tuning is only beneficial if a good teacher
