1
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:06,411
Here we quantify the performance of different NAS methods in our block search base.

2
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:15,013
We measure the accuracy after reaching a fixed search cost of 40 and also we measure the cost required to achieve a good accuracy of 76.6.

3
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:25,896
We can see that we can improve block wire NAS by utilizing reduced fine tuning proxy followed by full fine tuning and when a bad teacher is used it,

4
00:00:26,697 --> 00:00:31,080
we can improve the result by our proposed iterative strategy.
