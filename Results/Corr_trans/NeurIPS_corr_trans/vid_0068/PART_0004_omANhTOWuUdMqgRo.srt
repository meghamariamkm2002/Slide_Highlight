00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:14,952
This figure shows the accuracy of cell-based models from our search base, consisting of uniform blocks denoted in blue, and macro models consisting of different blocks denoted in red.

00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:18,893
Probable optimal points are additionally emphasized with markers.

4
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:20,613
There are two highlights.

5
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:27,735
First, the probability of frontier models with different blocks clearly dominates that of models with uniform blocks.

2.

7
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:34,002
The macro model is much larger, posing a challenge to the searching area.
