The focus of our paper is on the macro search space for neural architecture search.

00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:18,559
Now, traditional cell-based approach restricts the search to decide the operation and structure of a single block only, then the same block is repeated to form an end-to-end model.

macrosurface enables the individual search for each macroblock in a DNN, leading to better performance.

00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:31,167
However, it is expensive because the subspace size grows exponentially with the number of blocks.

To provide a systematic study of the performance of North's algorithm on a macro surface, we release blocks for a first large-scale benchmark and study of a macro surface.
