00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:10,472
First, in single-frame animal pose estimations, we benchmark SimpleBaseline HRNet, HRFormer, and ViTPose method.

2
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:21,915
We set up three settings to benchmark their performance, including using network weights pretrained on ImageNet, MS COCO Human Pose Estimat

3
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:26,716
With human pose pre-training, both CNN-based and vision transformer-b

4
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:29,499
These methods show performance improvements.

5
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:38,789
Besides, the benefit of using AP1000 for pre-training is less than that of using the human pose dataset for pre-training.

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:48,801
We suspect that it is caused by differences of distribution and data source and also the scale differences.
