Last, in animal pose tracking, we use representative object trackers with both CNN-based backbones and vision transformer-based backbones to track each animal instance across the video clips.

00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:20,802
And it can be observed that vision transformer-based trackers obtain slightly better performance.

00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:29,609
And we think these results imply the potential of plain vision-transformers as they fund mental models in the future work.
