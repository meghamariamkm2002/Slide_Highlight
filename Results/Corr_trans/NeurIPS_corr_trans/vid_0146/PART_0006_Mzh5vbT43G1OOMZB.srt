1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:09,309
Our tests employ three different types of vision transformers, vanilla ViT, DeiT, and ViT with improved augmentations and regularization.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,354
We measure the increase in robustness to distribution shifts, i.e.

3
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:17,656
the increase in accuracy for datasets with shifted distributions.

4
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,920
We use adversarial, real-world, and synthetic datasets.
