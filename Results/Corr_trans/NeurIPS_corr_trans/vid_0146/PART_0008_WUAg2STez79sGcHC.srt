1
00:00:00,896 --> 00:00:02,998
Next, we present some qualitative results.

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:09,202
As you can see, the different models are able to correct the wrong predictions after applying their method.

3
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:15,546
For example, the model here predicts that this cool bus is a snowplow due to the presence of the snow in the backgroud.

4
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:23,972
An additional example is this model that classifies the teddy bear as a ping-pong ball due to a sports consideration of only its path.

5
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:31,876
In both cases, our method is able to correct the wrong predictions by allowing the model to focus on the correct parts of the image.
