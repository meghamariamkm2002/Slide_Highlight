Therefore, we propose CarLane, the first three-way simple real-world domain adaptation benchmark for 2D lane detection, which allows single and multi-target, unsupervised domain adaptation.

We train several well-known user methods to establish baselines, including our own method.

Templation of the methods, baseline rates, as well as tools for data collection and labeling are publicly available.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to adapt lane detection models from simulation to multiple
