00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:03,892
We use the ultra-fast lane detection method as a backbone for lane detection.

2
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:06,715
The following UDA methods are evaluated.

3
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:10,558
Done, DANN, ADDA and our SGADA.

4
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:17,865
To work with UFLD, the UDA methods had to be adopted for grid-based lane detection, which is not always a trivial task.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,707
As can be seen on the right-side figure, grid-based lane detection divides the image into grid cells and classifies different lane types.

6
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:29,111
Results are given as an average over five runs.

7
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:32,995
Baselines, implementations and weights are publicly available.
