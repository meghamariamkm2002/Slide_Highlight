00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:09,634
In our experiments, the evaluated UDA methods achieved a maximum accuracy gain of around 4% and high positives and negative rates.

2
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:15,978
This shows that the methods are not able to achieve comparable results to the supervised baselines.

Furthermore, we observe FP and FN rates increase significantly on the multi-target task of MuLane.

4
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:32,995
We want to emphasize that FP and FN represent strongly detected and missing lanes, which can lead to crucial impacts on autonomous driving.
