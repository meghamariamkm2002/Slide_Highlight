00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:10,132
which make them kind of infeasible for real world out of the options because in practice we really want options to be simple and robust.

00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:20,295
So they are easy for users to understand and they are easy for the standard to compute and they can tolerate inaccurate priors.

00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:34,011
In this talk, we give a constant approximation posted price mechanism, which is both simple and robust for alibiders who are value maximizing subject to RI constraints.

4
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:42,093
To complement this result, we show that there is a non-trivial lower bound for posted price mechanisms with autobidders.

00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:47,755
And as by-products, we also give results about dynamic auctions and combinatorial auctions
