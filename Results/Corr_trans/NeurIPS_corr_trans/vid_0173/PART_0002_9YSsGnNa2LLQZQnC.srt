1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,592
These are very different from traditional bidders who are value maximizers.

2
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:10,714
They want to maximize their expected utility, which is the difference between the value and the payment.

3
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:15,677
And they don't care about the value, the ratio between value and payment.

4
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:19,019
So we understand these bidders quite well.

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,803
We have many maxims for them, like Myerson's, VCG, posted pricing, and others.

6
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,664
They are well studied.

7
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:32,225
On the other hand, for autobidders, we don't know so much.

8
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:43,711
Alibiders want to maximize their expected value, subject to the ROI constraint, which means the ratio between the expected value and the expected payment should be large enough.

9
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,272
We do have some maxims for them.

10
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:52,815
These maxims involve payment scalers, and sometimes we do prior-free approximations.
