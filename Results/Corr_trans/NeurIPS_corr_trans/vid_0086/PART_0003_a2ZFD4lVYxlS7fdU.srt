Meanwhile, most hospital staff interact with the EHR database using predefined rule conversion systems.

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:16,931
This means extending or modifying the systems requires special training, and this is a major bottleneck for them to freely use the database.

3
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:24,621
One alternative way is to build a system that can directly translate a natural language question into an SQL query.

4
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:33,648
With this system, the users can simply type or verbally ask their questions, and the system will return the answers from the database.

5
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,312
Imagine an AI speaker that answers questions on hospital data.

6
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:45,718
This will unleash the potential of EHR data, and anyone in the healthcare industry can easily access the information they want.
