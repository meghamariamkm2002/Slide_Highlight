To conclude, public health researchers can use mass codes to mine valuable medical information from tweets.

00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:26,528
For example, the dataset can be used as a training dataset for examining public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and drugs or tracking the public's mental status change during different COVID-19 phases and etc.

00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:35,055
Our experiments also show that current models have not fully exploited the data's potential.

00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:42,058
Therefore, we call for more efforts on developing models for social media-based public health studies.
