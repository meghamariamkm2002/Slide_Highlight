00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:15,972
For data pre-processing, we first remove non-English tweets and retweets.

3
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,493
Then we filter out the tweets containing URLs.

00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:27,095
Afterwards, we use a list of symptoms as keywords to match the tweets to extract medical-related tweets.

00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:31,341
Finally, 10,000 tweets are annotated.

00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:39,026
Among them, 6000 are randomly sampled, and the other 4000 are from the model labeled data.

00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,248
All of them are manually checked.

8
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:46,532
We define seven entity types based on public health research needs.

00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:52,260
including three general entity types and four medical entity types for annotation.

10
00:00:53,221 --> 00:01:02,955
