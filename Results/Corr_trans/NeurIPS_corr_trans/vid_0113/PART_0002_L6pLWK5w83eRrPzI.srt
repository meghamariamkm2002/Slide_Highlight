00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,632
To bridge the gap, we released METS-CoV data set.

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:22,643
This data set contains 10,000 tweets with seven types of entities, including four medical entity types, such as disease, drug, symptom, and vaccine, and three general entity types, like person, location, and organization.

3
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:28,307
To further investigate Twitter users' attitudes towards specific entities,

4
00:00:29,042 --> 00:00:37,349
Four types of entities, such as person, organization, drug, and vaccine, are selected and annotated with user sentiments.

5
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,154
Also, we designed detailed guidelines for annotating medical entities on tweets.

6
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:57,005
We benchmarked the performance of classical machine learning models and state-of-the-art deep learning models, including pre-training language models on NER and TSA tasks of machine learning.
