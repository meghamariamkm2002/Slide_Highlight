00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:06,117
So let's first talk about our causal structure model.

2
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:20,607
So in this model, the covariate will be history activities and treatments will be engagement with misinformation or information and outcomes will be characters of the post in the future.

3
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:25,050
They can be fully described by the conditional intensity function.

4
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:31,758
But because, you know, function is continuous, so it is hard to quantify the effect on them.

5
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:36,984
So we apply a functional F to project the function to a vector.

6
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:47,755
And in this way, we can compare the functional with treatment and without treatment to acquire the individual treatment effect with finite dimensions.
