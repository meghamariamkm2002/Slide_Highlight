00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:15,684
And after defining the causal model, we can use the neural network to estimate the treatment effects by learning conditional intensity function with maximum likelihood.

2
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:29,188
But here we may face a challenge, which is that the covariance could be correlated with the treatment because the platforms like Twitter, such as Reddit,

3
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:35,085
they will recommend you with the content that they believe you are very likely to click on.

4
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:38,929
So the covariate will be correlated with treatment.

5
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:48,982
So to solve this issue, we propose an adversarial balanced neural temporal point process that can remove such kind of correlation with theoretical guarantees.
